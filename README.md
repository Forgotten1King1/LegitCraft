## This repository includes all the essential configurations and files for EaglerCraft client and Microsoft Login. Here's how you can use it:

## How to Use the Repository
### Go to https://repl.it/create and click on the "Import from Github" button.
### Enter this repository link: https://github.com/HackerYijia/NXBackup
### Wait for the repository to import.
### Customize the server as per your requirements.
## How to Make a Server Outside of Repl
### You may want to host your Minecraft server outside of Replit. Here's how you can do it:

### Leave the server folder for other uses like a sub-server.
### Open the bungee/config.yml file.
### Find where it defines lobby and what it is.
### Copy paste these details and modify the name and address as you wish.
### You may add as many servers as you'd like.
### Last but not least. Go to bungee/plugins/EaglerXBungee/settings.yml.
### Make sure it's like this somewhere:
websocket_connection_timeout: 99000
websocket_handshake_timeout: 99000
### If it's the default 15000 and stuff, it will timeout you. 
## How Java Players Can Connect
### Java players can connect to your Minecraft server by using an external hosting site like Cxmpute or by using your repl name IP, which is {replname}.{username}.repl.co:25577 by default.
